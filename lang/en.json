    "title": "MSCR Testing: Ensuring Polymer Asphalt Quality for Heavy Traffic",
    "p1": "Polymer-modified asphalt is asphalt blended with polymers to enhance its performance and resistance to damage under traffic loading. One method to evaluate high-temperature performance of polymer asphalt is the MSCR (Multiple Stress Creep Recovery) test, which measures its deformation behavior under cyclic loading.",
    "p2": "In the MSCR test, different shear stress levels are applied for 1 second, followed by a 9-second recovery period. This cycle repeats 10 times at each stress level. Two key parameters are obtained: non-recoverable creep compliance (Jnr) and percent recovery (R). Jnr quantifies permanent deformation after recovery—lower Jnr means better rutting resistance. R indicates elastic recovery—higher R shows better viscoelasticity, absorbing traffic loads and mitigating fatigue cracking.",
    "p3": "A major factor affecting high-temperature performance is traffic loading, expressed as ESAL (Equivalent Single Axle Load), representing cumulative axle load impacts over road life. High ESAL roads require polymer asphalt with low Jnr and high R for durability.",
    "p4": "Thus, MSCR testing in relation to ESAL is vital for selecting the right polymer asphalt for heavy-traffic pavements. It guides mix design to match traffic and climate demands, ensuring long-lasting, high-performance road surfaces.",

    "title": "PG-76 Polymer Asphalt Double Chip Seal Application for Mining Roads in Indonesia",
    "p1": "Mining roads in Indonesia—such as those in Kalimantan and Sumatra—face extreme conditions: heavy traffic loads, high dust levels, standing water, and soil erosion. These factors cause pavement damage and high maintenance costs. A durable, long-lasting, and cost-effective preservation solution is therefore essential.",
    "p2": "One potential solution is the use of hot double chip seal with PG-76 polymer asphalt. This technology involves sequential application of two layers of hot binder and crushed aggregate over the existing pavement surface. It creates a new wearing course resistant to cracking, raveling, and bleeding.",
    "p3": "Hot double chip seal enhances skid resistance, provides waterproofing, and improves the pavement’s aesthetics. Additionally, this method dampens noise and reduces dust around mining sites.",
    "image1_alt": "Chip seal surface structure",
    "p4": "The use of PG-76 polymer asphalt—modified with styrene-butadiene or styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS)—adds significant value. This binder offers higher viscosity and elasticity than conventional asphalt, and is more resistant to extreme temperatures and aging. It delivers superior adhesion and cohesion, boosting chip seal durability under heavy traffic.",
    "image2_alt": "Types of chip seal",
    "p5": "According to the Asphalt Emulsion Manufacturers Association (AEMA), PG-76 hot double chip seal can reduce life-cycle costs by up to 25% compared to conventional asphalt. It can also extend pavement service life by up to 7 years and cut maintenance frequency by 50%.",
    "p6": "With all these advantages, PG-76 polymer asphalt hot double chip seal is the ideal choice for mining roads in Indonesia—offering long-term performance, cost savings, and environmental benefits."

    "title": "PG-76 Crumb Rubber Asphalt Solution for Double Chip Seal Applications on Mining Roads in Indonesia",
    "p1": "Asphalt is a widely used pavement material due to its durability, skid resistance, and noise-reducing ability. However, extreme conditions such as high temperatures, heavy traffic loads, and mining environments demand stronger and more resilient asphalt innovations.",
    "p2": "One such innovation is modifying asphalt with crumb rubber (CR) made from recycled used tires. Crumb rubber enhances asphalt performance against high temperatures, low-temperature cracking, fatigue, and aging. Additionally, it helps reduce tire waste and supports environmental sustainability.",
    "p3": "In practice, CR can be blended into asphalt using the wet process method. This technique allows CR to react directly with the asphalt, producing a homogeneous mixture with high adhesion and improved elasticity.",
    "image1_alt": "PG-76 crumb rubber asphalt application in the field",
    "p4": "An advanced form of crumb rubber is PG-76 CR, which is specifically modified to increase resistance to permanent deformation, cracking, and moisture. PG-76 offers higher viscosity and structural strength compared to standard CR, making it ideal for extreme mining conditions.",
    "p5": "The implementation of PG-76 CR is particularly well suited for the double chip seal method, which involves applying two successive layers of asphalt and aggregate over an existing pavement. This approach strengthens the wearing course, enhances resistance to water and weathering, and significantly extends service life.",
    "image2_alt": "Double chip seal application with crumb rubber",
    "p6": "Double chip seal with PG-76 CR offers several benefits: resilience to extreme weather, strong interlayer bonding, and significant reductions in noise and dust. For mining roads in Indonesia—where temperature fluctuations, heavy-machinery traffic, and challenging subgrade conditions are common—this technology provides a long-term, efficient, and eco-friendly solution.",
    "p7": "By using crumb rubber–modified PG-76 asphalt and the double chip seal method, companies can reduce maintenance costs, extend pavement life, and support productive tire-waste management. It represents a strategic step toward sustainable and modern mining infrastructure."
