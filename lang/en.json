        "p1": "Emulsion asphalt is produced by grinding asphalt or bitumen into microscopic particles and dispersing them in water using chemical emulsifiers. These tiny droplets of asphalt remain uniformly suspended until the emulsion is applied in the field. This method allows asphalt to be used in cold applications, making it safer and more environmentally friendly.",
        "p2": "The chemistry of asphalt emulsion determines the stability of the system. When applied, the emulsion eventually breaks—causing the asphalt and water suspension to separate. The water evaporates, leaving behind the asphalt residue which then coats and binds the aggregates in road construction applications.",
        "p3": "XOLABIT asphalt emulsions offer a wide range of applications, from tile adhesives to automotive undercoatings. However, their primary use is for road construction and maintenance, including seal coating, tack coats, and cold recycling systems. Our formulations are engineered to ensure superior adhesion, fast setting, and long-term durability.",
